## [Pysyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft)

### Encrypted, Decentralized Deep Learning library.
The goal of this library is to give the user the ability to efficiently train Deep Learning models in a homomorphically encrypted state, without needing to be an expert in either. Furthermore, by understanding the characteristics of both Deep Learning and Homomorphic Encryption, we hope to find a very performant combinations of the two. 


## [OpenMined-Unity](https://github.com/OpenMined/OpenMined)
### The OpenMined Unity Application.
OpenMined Unity Application applies the PySyft library into a Unity Application, and lets you do encrypted deep learning on Playstation4 or Xbox's!

## [Parfit](https://github.com/jmcarpenter2/parfit)
### Hyperparameter optimization library

A package for parallelizing the fit and flexibly scoring of sklearn machine learning models, with optional plotting routines.
