I don't usually write year-in-review posts. Feels a bit performative, like I'm supposed to have everything figured out just because the calendar flipped. But 2025 broke me in ways I didn't expect, and writing helps me make sense of things. So here we are.

This isn't a coherent narrative with a neat arc. Just lessons that landed hard enough to remember.

## On Health and Control

I spent the first half of 2025 dealing with a health crisis that I didn't see coming. It's funny how quickly everything you think matters just... doesn't, when your body stops cooperating.

**When health is lost, everything else is lost.** This sounds obvious until it's not theoretical anymore. All the planning, all the goals, all the spiritual practice - none of it means much when you can't get out of bed. Prevention actually is better than cure. I know, groundbreaking insight.

**Life happens. There's nothing certain.** I used to think I had some degree of control over outcomes. Do the work, get the results, right? Turns out control is mostly an illusion we tell ourselves to feel better. You can do everything "right" and still end up in situations you never planned for.

**Reality shows you your aukat.** Everything else is fantasy. When things got real, I saw how much of my self-image was just... made up. Mental constructs about how spiritual I was, how disciplined, how together. Reality has a way of revealing what's actually there versus what you tell yourself.

## On Overthinking and Action

**Over-analyzing and over-planning stop life from happening.** I'm guilty of both. Spending weeks thinking through every scenario, every possible outcome, every detail. Meanwhile, nothing actually moves forward. Perfection doesn't exist anyway, so why am I using it as an excuse to not start?

**Just do things.** Momentum gives energy. Progress happens through doing, not through perfect preparation. I learned this the hard way - the things that actually helped me move forward were small, imperfect actions. Not grand plans.

## On Expectations and Validation

**Expectation kills.** The gap between what I expected (from my practice, from people, from life) and what actually happened was the source of most of my suffering. Not the situation itself - the mental story about how it should have been different.

**Seeking external validation causes suffering.** Whether it's from teachers, doctors, friends, or the internet - looking for someone else to confirm you're okay, you're doing it right, you're on the right path. It's exhausting. The answers I needed were already inside, I just didn't trust them.

**Nobody cares.** Not in a cruel way, just in a realistic way. Nobody cares about your work, your problems, your insights more than you do. So stop waiting for external permission or validation. Do what matters to you and let go of what others think.

## On Spirituality and Looking Within

**The guru chase is meaningless.** I used to think the next mantra, the next technique, the next teacher would unlock something. Maybe for some people it does. For me, it became a distraction from actually sitting with what is. Looking within gives more answers than collecting spiritual practices like Pokemon cards.

## On People and Attachment

**Mental attachment causes suffering.** To people, to outcomes, to how things "should" be. The tighter the grip, the more it hurts when things change. And things always change.

**You can't fix people.** I need to tattoo this somewhere. The urge to help, to fix, to make someone see what seems so obvious - it's a trap. People change when they're ready, not when you're ready for them to change. Let go.

## On Meaning

**There is no purpose or meaning in anything. It's all made up.** This might sound depressing, but I actually find it freeing. We create meaning. We assign purpose. Once you accept that, you can stop searching for some cosmic answer and just... be. Do things because they matter to you, not because they're objectively meaningful.

I don't know if any of this will stick, or if I'll forget it all by next year and need to relearn everything again. Probably the latter. But writing it down helps.

If you made it this far - thanks for reading. Maybe some of this resonates. Maybe none of it does. Either way, take care of yourself. Start with your health. Everything else flows from there.
