I've been thinking about why most projects fail to hit their mark.

Honestly, it's probably not what you'd expect. It's not usually because of bad execution or lack of resources. Most of the time, it's because we never really figured out what we were aiming for in the first place.

And I think AI is making this worse. Maybe I'm wrong, but hear me out.

## The Problem with Instant Solutions

Don't get me wrong - I love that I can spin up a working prototype in minutes with ChatGPT or Claude. The barriers to building stuff have never been lower, which is incredible.

But these days, I keep seeing executives walk into meetings with half-baked prototypes they knocked together using Claude Code or Cursor over the weekend. "Look, I already built it! How hard can it be to finish?" they say, waving around a demo that barely holds together. And everyone nods along like this makes perfect sense.

Here's what I'm noticing, and maybe you've seen this too: **when you can build anything, people think they should build everything.**

Someone mentions a problem and within seconds - I'm talking seconds - solutions start flying. "Let's add a dashboard!" "We need a new microservice!" "What if we train a custom model?" The conversation jumps straight to implementation details before anyone's really thought through what we're trying to solve. It's kind of manic, honestly.

## The Hidden Costs of Easy Building

LLMs are incredible at turning vague ideas into working code. But they can't tell you if the idea is worth pursuing in the first place. They'll happily generate a perfectly functional solution to a problem that doesn't need solving. I've done this myself more times than I care to admit.

The marginal cost of adding new software is approaching zero. But what's the price of understanding, testing, and trusting that code? Higher than ever, I think.

LLMs shift the workload - they don't remove it. The last mile still requires real architectural thinking, proper testing, and sound judgment. But we're acting like we solved the hard parts.

This is where common sense seems to be quietly slipping away. We're so focused on how quickly we can build something that we forget to ask whether we should build it at all.

## The Advanced Idiot Approach

Here's what typically happens - and I've been guilty of this too: Someone identifies a problem. Maybe users are complaining about something, or metrics are trending in the wrong direction. Everyone gets excited about the cleverness of their technical solutions. We start planning sprints and writing prompts for code generation.

But we skip over the most important part: really understanding what we're trying to achieve and why.

This is where what I call the **"Advanced Idiot approach"** has started saving my ass.

Instead of jumping straight to solutions, you ask the questions that feel almost too basic. Questions that make you sound like you don't get it:

- "What exactly are we trying to solve here?"
- "How will we know if this works?"
- "What happens if we do nothing?"
- "Are we sure this is actually a problem?"

These questions make you sound slow. They derail conversations when everyone else is ready to start building. Sometimes people look at you like you're missing something obvious. I used to hate that feeling.

But here's the thing - and it took me way too long to learn this - those "obvious" things are often where projects go sideways.

When you force yourself to articulate the actual problem, weird things happen. You discover that what seemed like one clear issue is actually three different problems masquerading as one. Or you realize the thing everyone wants to fix isn't actually broken - something else entirely is causing the symptoms.

I probably sound like I have this all figured out. I don't. I still catch myself jumping to solutions all the time.

## The Bilbao Effect

There's this story about Frank Gehry that stuck with me. He's the architect who designed the Guggenheim in Bilbao. When officials asked him to renovate an old warehouse into a museum, his first question was: **"Why are you doing this project?"**

They wanted to boost tourism and put Bilbao on the map. Once Gehry understood that, he realized a renovated warehouse wouldn't achieve that goal. He convinced them to build something completely new instead - something that would actually generate the kind of attention they were after.

The result became known as the "Bilbao effect" - when bold architecture transforms an entire city's economy.

Imagine if he'd just taken the original brief and delivered exactly what they asked for. All that investment would have barely moved the needle. But most of us would have just said "sure, here's your renovated warehouse."

## The Real Skill

I'm not designing world-famous museums, and you probably aren't either. But the principle seems to hold. When you start with the right frame - really understanding what you're trying to accomplish - everything else becomes clearer.

The solution that seemed obvious at first might not be the right one anymore. Or maybe it is, but for different reasons than you originally thought.

Either way, you're building something that has a real chance of working instead of something that just... works.

In a world where we can build anything in minutes, maybe the real skill isn't coding faster. **It's thinking slower.** Taking time to understand the problem before falling in love with solutions.

So next time someone comes to you with a project, try playing the Advanced Idiot. Ask the basic questions. Make them explain the why before you get excited about the how.

You might feel a little slow for asking. But you'll save yourself from building the wrong thing beautifully - even if you can build it in record time.

At least, that's what I'm telling myself these days.
