After 9 years building ML systems, I've learned that the sexiest algorithm is worthless if users don't engage with it. The real work isn't in the model—it's in the product wrapped around it.

At BetterUp, we rearchitected our core ML system not because the old one was technically inferior, but because it couldn't scale with user needs. The new system drives $8M+ in annual impact, not through better accuracy, but through better integration with actual workflows.

## The Pragmatist's View

This is the pragmatist in me speaking: build systems that solve real problems for real people. The elegance of your architecture matters less than whether someone's day gets easier because of what you shipped.

Three things I've learned:

**First**, synthetic data generation often matters more than model architecture. Clean, relevant training data beats fancy algorithms every time.

**Second**, the UI/UX around your AI is the product—not the model itself. Users don't care about your F1 scores; they care about whether the tool helps them get their job done.

**Third**, if you can't explain why your system made a decision, users won't trust it. Explainability isn't just nice-to-have—it's table stakes.

## The Current State

We're in an era where LLMs can do remarkable things, but most AI products still suck because they're built by people who love the technology more than the problem it's supposed to solve.

The fascination with the latest model architecture, the pursuit of state-of-the-art benchmarks, the obsession with parameters and FLOPs—none of this matters if the end user can't figure out how to integrate your tool into their existing workflow.

## Start With The Problem

Start with the problem. Build for humans. Ship frequently. The rest is just implementation details.

The best AI products I've seen solve boring, practical problems really well. They take something tedious and make it effortless. They don't try to replace human judgment—they augment it.
