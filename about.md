I'm bharath, an Independent researcher in Artificial intelligence. Currently I work as a Machine learning engineer at voyagenius labs in mysore. Before that I used to work at  predictive research in bangalore as a data consultant, and I completed my B.Tech in electronics and communication engineering at visvesvaraya technological university. I'm from mysore, India.

You can call me a data geek. I like to dive in and try to find creative ways to solve problems.As of now, I'm trying to address the issue of fairness in algorithms that we design, or more succinctly on "how to make our algorithms fair", along with this my research areas of interest include deep learning, reinforcement learning, cognitive neuroscience and Bayesian statistics.
I'm also passionate about block-chains, decentralized apps & opensource software and to that end I've been working as a collaborator on a very interesting project with the openmined organization that aims to provide encrypted, decentralized  deep learning. you can check that out [here](github.com/OpenMined)

some of the opensource projects that I contribute to are: 

1. [Pysyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft): Encrypted, Decentralized Deep Learning library.
2. [OpenMined-Unity](https://github.com/OpenMined/OpenMined): The OpenMined Unity Application.
3. [Parfit](https://github.com/jmcarpenter2/parfit): A package for parallelizing the fit and flexibly scoring of sklearn machine learning models, with optional plotting routines.
4. [dframeutils](https://github.com/bharathgs/dframeutils): simple utility tools for dataframes in Python

I am interested in applying ML to solve the most pressing problems we face today.
