Hello, I'm Bharath G.S.

I'm curious about the nature of reality, consciousness, and what it means to live authentically. I spend time exploring the space between thoughts, studying advaita, trika & practicing kriyayoga.
I also explore and research breathwork for its physiological, psychological and transcendental applications.
Through soch, the journaling platform I co-founded, I'm exploring how AI can support deeper self-understanding and intentional living.
I'm also a product engineer building AI/LLM systems that help people create meaningful products.
