When I sit to meditate, initially the outer noise dominates. Cars passing, birds chirping, the hum of the air conditioner. But as I settle deeper, something shifts. The external sounds recede into background, and the mental noise becomes louder.

This is where it gets interesting. I notice thoughts arising—some mundane, others charged with emotion. The automatic response is to engage, to follow the thread, to become the thinker of the thought. But what if we don't?

## The Observer

I've been exploring this question: when exactly do we identify with a thought? Can we catch the precise moment we go from observing a mental event to becoming it? It's subtle, like trying to observe the observer.

The ears hear, the eyes see, the skin feels. None of this can be controlled unless we deliberately avoid contact with objects. But when they encounter objects, processing happens automatically. We have no say.

## Thoughts as Objects

Extending this observation: when a thought comes in contact with the mind, thinking happens. I have no way to control it. This suggests that thoughts—even thoughts about "my" identity—are not me. So who or what am I?

The space between thoughts might hold the answer. Or perhaps the question itself is the answer.

*In that space, there's just awareness—pure, unconditioned, without an object. It's not thinking about awareness; it's awareness being aware of itself.*
